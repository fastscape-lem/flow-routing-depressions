A Versatile, Linear Complexity Algorithm for Flow Routing in Topographies with Depressions (code)
=================================================================================================

This repository is a snapshot version of the `fastscapelib`_ library,
which contains all development code related to the paper "Cordonnier,
G., Bovy, B., and Braun, J.: A Versatile, Linear Complexity Algorithm
for Flow Routing in Topographies with Depressions, Earth Surf. Dynam.,
2019" (link_).

This read-only repository can be used for reproducing the results
shown in that paper. For other purposes, it is preferred to directly
use the actively maintained fastscapelib library.
